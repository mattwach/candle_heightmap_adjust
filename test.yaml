# Some Notes:
#   - You don't want to cut where your isolation traces will be.
#   - Depending on where you placed the origin of your design, some of these
#     numbers may be begative.
#   - Using 0,0 as a starting point may be problematic when you
#     switch bits and want to rezero using the probe, you may
#     want to choose something outside of that point for that reason
